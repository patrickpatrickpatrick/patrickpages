## [DIE HARD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrObVX_NE7U&list=RDBrObVX_NE7U&start_radio=1) / [MAKE OUT WITH MY CHOPPA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m62C4760yHM&list=RDm62C4760yHM&start_radio=1) - CHE


Che isn’t beating the hero worship allegations with [REST IN BASS: ENCORE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest_in_Bass#Rest_in_Bass:_Encore) (the [release date doesn’t help](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Lotta_Red)). Most of the B-side could be mixed into Whole Lotta Red and an unseasoned listener wouldn’t notice. The A-side however frequently hits the highs of the original release. MAKE OUT WITH MY CHOPPA is an almost-parody of rage with a beat that sounds like someone repeatedly dropping metal pipes on a concrete floor while blasting a dying air horn. DIE HARD is considerably more palatable, it’s the closest to a pop-song you’ll find in either incarnation of REST IN BASS. I’ll leave the choice of which to listen to for the reader (apologies if you don’t like either).


## [We Were Never The Same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNfRyuSMiBc&list=RDyNfRyuSMiBc&start_radio=1) - Converge


I can’t think of another band that has been as consistent for as long as Converge. So it’s no surprise that they’ve released another stellar single in the lead up to what will (likely) be another great album.


## [My Soul / Half Pint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHbfolRt93U&list=RDaHbfolRt93U&start_radio=1) - Dry Cleaning


Dry Cleaning continue to augment their signature style with new influences and instrumentation on their latest album. Secret Love has ample (expected and desirable) stick but a higher ratio of (”earworms”? optimism?) carrot than on their previous records. My Soul / Half Pint highlights this well, initially sounding like classic Dry Cleaning before turning into a glam-rock chart-topper that would have given Mott the Hoople a run for their money (compliment!!!!).


## [Lawyers, Guns and Money (live)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ekofgh3_Vw&list=RD2ekofgh3_Vw&start_radio=1) - Warren Zevon


In extremely unsurprising news, a 30-something year-old white man discovers he enjoys the music of Warren Zevon. If you’re uninitiated,  give [Stand In The Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_in_the_Fire) a spin. Akin to [The Name of This Band is Talking Heads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_This_Band_Is_Talking_Heads), not only a great recording of an artist at their creative peak but also a greatest hits compilation of which Lawyers, Guns and Money is a highlight.


## [Slick As Snails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAfI-etLP5I) - Robert Pollard, Doug Gillard


[Speak Kindly of Your Volunteer Fire Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_Kindly_of_Your_Volunteer_Fire_Department) should be spoken as kindly of as the most highly regarded Guided By Voices albums. Not quite as lo-fi as [Vampire On Titus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTO7Nk0Uy8s) but lacking the studio sheen of[ Do The Collapse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuPf3OhbcGw&list=RDCuPf3OhbcGw&start_radio=1), this Pollard and Gillard side-project features longer (over 3 minutes!) length songs with more elaborate structures (guitar solos!). Slick As Snails is a perfect encapsulation of what makes SKOYVFD (out of the hundred or so other albums in the Pollard universe you could listen to) a special record (but you should listen to the whole thing too, [it’s so good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy7JmyAUMAg&list=RDsy7JmyAUMAg&start_radio=1)).


## [X-French Tee Shirt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eLnhDzf6p8&list=RD0eLnhDzf6p8&start_radio=1) - Shudder To Think


[Pony Express Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pony_Express_Record) by Shudder To Think is weird and expensive sounding in a way that instantly dates it to the era in which [Warner Bros. signed The Boredoms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzConcr_03g&list=RDSzConcr_03g&start_radio=1), [Sony released a noise Christmas covers compilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM9NqSDl12I&list=RDdM9NqSDl12I&start_radio=1) and [Angel Dust was certified gold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAlFtRY3FQ&list=RDOwAlFtRY3FQ&start_radio=1). This band and record deserve to be mentioned more often in conversations about the best alternative rock of the 90s and if you don’t believe me just listen to “X French Tree Shirt”!
