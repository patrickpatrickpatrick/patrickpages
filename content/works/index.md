### What If They Don't Have Eyes (2021)

Time frame: < 1 week  
Tech stack: Node, HTML, CSS, Javascript  
Libraries used: Discord, Socket.io  
Role(s): Developer, Designer  

Developed for a collaborative art-work by Steven He and Mary Pedicini as part of the [SW11NDOWS](https://www.anitagarwal.com/sw11ndows) show. The art piece was [a public sculpture which contained a QR code](https://www.anitagarwal.com/sw11ndows?pgid=l0ro6tcm-1205ec44-66fe-4b00-a3dd-d7e39b76ce61) that linked to the application. 

Concept was a publicly viewable real-time online role-play between a human (Steven) and an alien (Mary). Due to the limited timeframe, used a Discord bot (to scrape the messages sent in a channel) and Socket.io (to update the website when new messages were sent, to track number of users online, to pull from history of messages if user scrolled up).

The design is inspired by Windows 95 and was a collaboration with Steven He.
