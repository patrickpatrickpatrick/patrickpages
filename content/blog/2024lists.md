## Music

We’re now even further removed from 2020 than it was ever thought possible and the decade truly feels like it has begun. It was yet another year where an avalanche of interesting records were released and there’s still much (454, Jawnino, Ka (RIP), SahBabii, etc) I haven’t gotten round to yet. Been an especially banner year also for people I know or know of putting out incredible music too, shouts out to all music makers.

## Video Games

I’m learning how to drive and discovered this year that if you use manual transmission in driving games that they transform from droll wheelbarrow simulators to nailbiting experiences. Gran Turismo 4 is my favourite game of the year.

I didn’t play enough modern games to really make a list this year. I thought that the new Golden Idol game was pretty decent but not quite as good as the original. 

I’m a massive Balatro hater, sorry! It might be the country where I live (and my own issues with dopamine regulation) but it still feels gross and predatory even if it isn’t real gambling! I’m perhaps too disconnected to be aware of but I find it curious that there’s no interesting discourse in video games about addiction. Predatory tactics (and actual gambling) are rife in the mainstream now and it seems like the indie scene’s reaction is to celebrate this and not comment on it? You can also look at something like Vampire Survivors, one of the most acclaimed games from last year, the design of which was informed by the developer’s time in the gaming (in the other sense) industry. Is there really any art in shovelling the most addictive mechanics into a trough and saying “have at it”?
