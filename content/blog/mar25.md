## What I was listening to

### Vacuous

Life After Death 2 is the second instalment of an annual (there’s going to be a third!) weekend dedicated to heavy (or adjacent) music. It’s organised by record shop and label Crypt of the Wizard, who over the years have become trustworthy and well-connected curators of note in the “____ metal” world.

If you’re slightly into this style of music, I’d recommend going next year. Though only familiar with a minority of the lineup, I enjoyed every act I saw. There was something for everyone (into this music). From serene dungeon synth to black metal, from pagan lo-fi beats to industrial black metal, from “frog concert” to black(-ened death) metal (not to mention harsh noise).

I'm highlighting Vacuous here as I was so impressed by their set that I had to immediately cop the vinyl. That’s unusual for me, especially a death metal record that I'll only be able to play on rare occasions!

Listen to 

### Coma - Eiko Ishibashi

I’ve written about Eiko Ishibashi before but it’s been about her instrumental albums or soundtracks. "Antigone" is her first "singer-songwriter" album for several years and incorporates sounds explored on records such as "For McCoy" and the "Drive My Car" soundtrack. I love the emphasis on percussion on this track (an aspect that I've enjoyed about other Ishibashi compositions) and it's a successful revisit and expansion of the mode of songwriting she was in when I first encountered her music.

### Panda (Nananana) - YT

I assumed from the OI! album art that YT would be offering a British take on the current snap revival. In fact, YT is offering a British take on the current and increasingly popular jerk rap genre.

OI! is (even) less heady and more immediate than other acclaimed jerk rap. This is decidedly  pop music (not a slight!) and sands down some edges (not a slight!) in favour of stickier hooks. Although I wouldn't describe OI! as snap, the beats are also clearly taking influence from that era of hip-hop and "ringtone rap".

I'd recommend the entire tape as it's so short but if I had to pick a highlight it'd be the bordering-on-annoying (like so many snap classics) hook, jersey-tinged production and DS referencing music video of Panda (Nananana).

### Ester Wind - Cloakroom

In the recent shoegaze revival, Hum loom large. At one time they'd probably have been grouped into the - extremely broad net of - 90s alternative metal. They made music that combined the texture and heaviness of more experimental drone metal but tethered it to earth with more conventional structures. Nu-metal eventually took the sounds of alternative metal to make pop music but emphasised the aggressive sound of Helmet and Melvins instead of Hum and the softer songs of Deftones.

Esther Wind by Cloakroom is an alchemic mix of alternative metal but unlike nu-metal bands they increase the ratio of Hum in the mix. The song starts with Stanier-like fills, ends with Buzzo-like sludge and all the while has the excellent guitar tones of You Wish You Were An Astronaut. Their latest record is an excellent time for people who enjoy recorded guitars and comes recommended from me (a recorded guitars enjoyer).

### Total Euphoria - caroline

caroline's S/T was a refreshing take on post-rock, a genre I usually use as a pejorative (with obvious exceptions). Though denied at the time of release, to me the infuence of emo is what set their debut apart from other post-rock works (a genre which "old" emo bands tend to "graduate" to). Their latest record is one of my favourites of the year, it combines BIG ambitious post-rock compositions with intimate and close-sounding alternative-RnB textures to express the heart-on-sleeve yearning of the best emo records. "caroline 2" is made by "an actual band" but it's also an "in-the-studio" record (seeing them live - which you should do if you have the chance - confirms this). Total Europhia was the lead single and it's a great introduction to the album (it's also the first track).
