## Music

I keep forgetting to log all the music I listen to, I then have to painfully recall from memory what I actually enjoyed each year. The sheer amount of great music released this year however made this list a lot easier than last year.

I'll say without caveats that it was "a great year for music". In pretty much every genre (that I keep up with) there was something interesting released. For the most part the "discourse" was very ignorable because it was so easy to find something else to listen to. It feels like the strongest year of this decade so far and one that I think will be looked back on very favourably at the end of the 2020s.

Of the music I haven't listened to yet, there's a lot of hip-hop I need to catch up on (MIKE, Sexyy Red, Veeze, Billy Woods, Earl Sweatshirt). I'm sure there must be some seminal metal/hardcore releases (need to listen to the Liturgy record) that I haven't (yet) heard (as that's probably the biggest hole in my list of genres-that-I'm-typically-very-into this year).

Here are some lists of what I've been listening to the most this year but also I've probably forgotten, like, more than half of it lol

### Previous releases < 2023

- [Milton Nascimento and Lô Borges - Clube da Esquina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clube_da_Esquina_(album)) (the best record I heard for the first time all year tbh I love it so much)
- [Faraquet - The View From This Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_View_from_This_Tower)
- [Storm & Stress - Storm & Stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_%26_Stress_(album))

- [Orchid - Dance Tonight! Revolution Tomorrow!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Tonight!_Revolution_Tomorrow!)

### Goblin mode

- [Ken Carson record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Great_Chaos) is a worse '[Whole Lotta Red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Lotta_Red)'? he uses too many words (and those words and the delivery of those words are bad)
- liked '[Twin Plagues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Plagues)' way more, sorry
- ever read a press cycle so bad it makes you regret writing a letter about how much you wanted to see them to play live into the Guardian when you were bored at work one day lol
- thought 'Guts' would be like '[Shōso Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dso_Strip)', it isn't :(

## Books

After finishing [The Woman in White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Woman_in_White_(novel)) (really liked it but doesn't top [The Moonstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moonstone)), I picked up a Philip Marlowe omnibus from an old books stall at a random market for a reasonable price (so I wouldn't have to read any of the books over 600 pages that are still on my shelf).

Over the course of 2023 I ended up reading most of the Marlowe books (shout out to Fopp's 3-for-2 offer). Similar to [Hangover Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangover_Square) and [Crime & Punishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_Punishment), I love how evocative Chandler's works are of a particular place (that's very familiar to the author) at a particular time (in their own lives). Taken as a whole, I think the series is a rumination on how one's perspective changes as they get older and learning to eventually accept the passage of time. Reading all the Marlowe books, as time goes on and the author ages and L.A. changes, you can see how the aim of Marlowe/Chandler's ire gradually moves from indviduals to the system that those individuals are caught up in.

It's why I would recommend [The Long Goodbye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Goodbye_(novel)) (it's the second last in the series) as the must read of all the ones I've read. It has a high concentration of conversations with weird little guys (clearly Chandler's favourite part about writing the Marlowe stories); a (mostly) followable plot which acts as (slightly) more than just a weird little guy delivery mechanism; and Chandler turning his weaponised cynicism on himself.

I would still say read them all to get an engaging developing portrait of a place (L.A.) and a person (Chandler). And it is pretty fun to read Chandler rip into every person he met during his tenure as a screenwriter in Hollywood in [The Little Sister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Sister).

## Movies

I fell way behind on movies this year (again). My highlights this year are pretty much all films I saw at various retrospectives.

One of these highlights was going to The Cinema Museum to see a selection of rediscovered rarities from the 1920s. It was my first time going to The Cinema Museum. Big fan of chaotic volunteer-run museums that have the feel of exploring the collections store of the museum rather than the museum itself (see also [The Centre for Computing History](https://www.computinghistory.org.uk/) in Cambridge). Of the movies I saw on that day, I particularly enjoyed Ozu's [Dragnet Girl](https://letterboxd.com/film/dragnet-girl/) (ended with a chase scene that seemed plucked out of a film made 40-50 years in the future).

There was also the [New Taiwanese Cinema](https://www.thegardencinema.co.uk/season/new-taiwanese-cinema/) Retrospective at [The Garden Cinema](https://www.thegardencinema.co.uk/). I saw [A Brighter Summer Day](https://letterboxd.com/film/a-brighter-summer-day/) (my first Edward Yang) and [Rebels of the Neon God](https://letterboxd.com/film/rebels-of-the-neon-god/) (my first Tsai Ming-liang). Both were fantastic and I want to watch more films by both directors.

It was also great to see [Film Orchestrated: Silent Slapsticks](https://brixchamber.com/gigs/Ritzy-2023) with the Brixton Chamber Orchestra live at the Ritzy Picturehouse Cinema. I had seen silent movies with instrumentation before but never with a full orchestra. My favourite of the shown films was [The Goat](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-goat/) (with Buster Keaton).

The 4K IMAX re-release of [Stop Making Sense](https://letterboxd.com/film/stop-making-sense/) was also very good (but I want them to do a remaster of the [bootleg Rome 1980 concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwWW742T0Wc&t=93s&pp=ygUSdGFsa2luZyBoZWFkcyByb21l)).

The only 2023 releases I saw this year were [Beau Was Afraid](https://letterboxd.com/film/beau-is-afraid/), [Barbie](https://letterboxd.com/film/barbie/) and [EO](https://letterboxd.com/film/eo/). Next year will be the year I watch more movies (I say this every year). To hold me accountable, please follow [my Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/evilguii/).

## Video Games

Started the year playing [Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Tears_of_the_Kingdom) ended the year playing [Baldur's Gate 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_3). Apart from that I played the [Resident Evil 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_4_(2023_video_game)) remake. Of those, I think Resident Evil 4 was the best. I really wanna play the new [Armoured Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armored_Core_VI:_Fires_of_Rubicon) and get a [Steam Deck](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck).

Years ago I probably would have been dismayed that I only played sequels of very large franchises instead of cool indie games but all those games rule so I don't care lol

I also finally played [God Hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Hand) and it totally whips. [OutRun 2006: Coast 2 Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OutRun_2006:_Coast_2_Coast) is still probably the best game ever made.
