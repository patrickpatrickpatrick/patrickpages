Busy month so smaller round-up! Listened to fewer tracks, had less time to work on the site. Trying to also be stricter on schedule so I can actually get something out on time next month (lol)

## What I've Been Listening To

### White Bell Bird - World's Loudest Bird Call

Check this out! Birds are so cool!

### 星になれた - Yura Yura Teikoku

A sad reason to return to the fantastic discography of [Yura Yura Teikoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yura_Yura_Teikoku) as legendary bassist [Chiyo Kamekawa passed away this month](https://twitter.com/zelonerecords/status/1777685969078223170). His contributions to the one of the greatest power-trios in all rock will never be forgotten and there are countless tunes I could highlight. For Kamekawa specifically however, I'm selecting a live recording of Hoshi Ni Nareta. YYT were legendary for their live shows (they have pernament place on my 'if you could see any band live from any point in history' list) and [Na.ma.shi.bi.re.na.ma.me.ma.i](https://www.discogs.com/release/2250478-Yura-Yura-Teikoku-Namashibirenamamemai-%E3%81%AA%E3%81%BE%E3%81%97%E3%81%B3%E3%82%8C%E3%81%AA%E3%81%BE%E3%82%81%E3%81%BE%E3%81%84) is the best recorded evidence of this. This live version of Hoshi Ni Nareta resembles the studio original in terms of structure but the sheer power of just the core trio of YYT performing the song at a blisteringly loud volume is awe-inspiring to behold. To top off the intensity of the performance, Kamekawa lays down an earth-shattering bass solo during the climax of the track that gives me goosebumps every time I listen to it.

RIP Chiyo Kamekawa, Yura Yura Teikoku forever.

### Sidewalk - A Country Western

Yes, they’re a [guitar based band](blog/mar24/#they-are-gutting-a-body-of-water-greg-mendez-sun-organ-krillin) [from Philadelphia](/blog/mar24/#full-body-2-ador-ation-audiotree-live-session). This time however the vibes are [Slanted And Enchanted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slanted_and_Enchanted) rather than [Loveless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loveless_(album)). [Life On The Lawn](https://acountrywestern.bandcamp.com/album/life-on-the-lawn) doesn’t reinvent the wheel but it does conjure up a well-used wheel from 30 years ago that’s been patched up with my [favourite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoegaze) [styles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_country) of [rock music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_pop).

### Portrait of Tracy - Jaco Pastorius

Just go listen to it (it's short)!

### Subete Urimomo - Aunt Sally

The algorithm showed me this one - I’m a fraud - but it actually rules. Probably not dissimilar to the most popular “rock” music coming out of the U.K. right now (no, I'm not linking to any of it) but I think the crazy organ playing, speedily delivered verses and lo-fi production makes it more compelling! Just a fun song, for [Otoboke Beaver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBC26YAecWs) listeners!

### A Dream Goes On Forever - Vegyn ft. John Glacier

This album is Vegyn’s best work yet but I find it so hard to get past the first track. I keep winding it back, what an opener! I’m generally not super into producer songs with guest vocalists but unlike a lot of cuts from those records it sounds as if (even if that isn't the case!) the song has been made in mind for [John Glacier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mvb_L6bXUw). Unexpectedly sweet and unassumingly uplifting, sounds better than you remember Boards of Canada being.
