### What If They Don't Have Eyes (2022)

Time frame: 1 week  
Tech stack: Node, HTML, CSS, Javascript  
Libraries used: Discord, Socket.io  

Developed in less than 1 week for a collaborative art-work by Steven He and Mary Pedicini. Concept was a publicly viewable real-time online role-play between a human (Steven) and an alien (Mary). Due to restrictive timeframe, used a Discord bot (to scrape the messages sent in a channel) and Socket.io (to update the website when new messages were sent, to track number of users online, to pull from history of messages if user scrolled up).
