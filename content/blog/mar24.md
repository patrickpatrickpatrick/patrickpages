Not going to comment on how late this is!

## What I've Been Listening To

### Amen Dunes - Boys

“Freedom” is a record that crept up on me. At the time of its release I felt pretty indifferent to it but years later I revisited it and found a totally different album. It was all I listened to for weeks, like being a teenager and getting completely obsessed with a classic rock record

It’s been an agonising wait for the next Amen Dunes record and so far it's shaping up to be nothing like anything Damon has released before. "Boys" is the most conventional of the tracks released so far and it still deliberately 

### krillin - They Are Gutting A Body of Water, Greg Mendez, SUN ORGAN

### US Maple - Open A Rose

One could subsist entirely on the produce of the Jim O’Rourke extended universe and be entirely fulfilled. Not only does this band have connections to O’Rourke, they’re from Chicago, this album came out between 1990-2009 and it was released on Drag City. Those facts alone make it a worthy listen regardless of what the record actually sounds like

### Hotline TNT - Beauty Filter

Might be the best take on the Ride-style of shoegaze I've heard (maybe even better than Ride themselves lol). This is probably what I wanted from country-gaze all along. Really regret not seeing them at The George while I had the chance!

### Happy End

Ah, so this is finally on Spotify! Hosono is similar to O’Rourke, any record that can be connected to him is worth listening to him (especially ones in which he plays or writes on!). This record is particularly notable for being one of the first popular rock albums with Japanese lyrics. The music on here is lushly produced and very inspired by the Beatles, the Byrds and the Kinks. It's short, engrossing listen and definately worthy of it's hallowed repuation. 

### BBBBBB - Shin God 2

### Full Body 2 -


## Patch Notes

There's now a works section! This meant digging out two projects (What If They Don't Have Eyes and Atamaca Garden Web Portal) and making them work again after a few years. This was surprisingly pretty straight-forward even with Discord API changes and create-react-app being discontinued! I'm not sure if the website design is very good at presenting this type of content in this way but oh well!

There's now no 'About'. I didn't know what to put on there and now you can just look at my Works and read my blog posts to understand who I am :) (most job applications just let you specify your LinkedIn profile address seperately anyway!!)
