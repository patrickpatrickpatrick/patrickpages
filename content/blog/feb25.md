## What I Listened To

### Father - Jim Legaxy

I'm very excited for 'black british music (2025)'. Hoping it doesn't become 'black british music (2026)', please release it this year!

### Scorpio - James K, hoodie

I don't know the artists of this track, I saw a tweet referencing this release without a description of what it sounded like and gave it a listen. It's an enveloping mixture of shoegaze and dub, it could be 10 minutes longer and I wouldn't mind. Should ideally be listened to at an anti-social volume in a dark room.

### $0 - Cameron Winter

'Heavy Metal' was my most listened to album this month. In my mind, it's comparable to Destroyer's fantastic run of albums in 00s in which Dan Bejar made - a convincing - case that he should be put into the songwriting canon of a different decade. Lush instrumentation is purposely ruined by an unusually delivered litany of half remembered memories, occasionally interjected by outbursts of violent imagery and obscenities. Portrait of the artist as a loser. Personally (Rubies is one my favourite records) I'm quite into that.

$0 is a highlight of the record for me, a track in which words almost entirely fail Winter. Most of the song he yelps and moans wordlessly as the instrumentation falls apart around him before finally giving up on verbal communication altogether. It's a striking depiction of the frustration of failing to make another person understand how you feel.

### Chozen / The Prevalance of Issues - Cities Aviv

Cities Aviv latest output (I still really like Come To Life, though stylistically very divorced from any recent release) is as 'free'-feeling as 'freestyle rap' could be. This is not only referring to the verses but also the beats too. Exploring the recent works of Cities Aviv is magical, it's like listening to the sound of synapses firing and ideas being formed right in front of you. It makes you want to stop what you're doing and make music.

I've recently been listening to MAN PLAYS THE HORN and Working Title For The Album Secret Waters. Chozen / The Prevalance of Issues is a highlight to me for the incredible beat switch half way into track, that fails to lose power no matter how many times I hear it.

### Limbs - Agalloch

Agalloch rule so much, I just randomly put Ashes Against The Grain on again and forgot how good it was. It seems as if they're back together now? Hoping they release something new soon, it seems as if they laid the ground for the "metal album that is included in the album of the year list of a publication that isn't dedicated solely to covering metal"-kind of bands.
