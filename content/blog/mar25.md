## What I was listening to

### Vacuous

Life After Death 2 is the second instalment of an annual (there’s going to be a third!) weekend dedicated to heavy (or heavy adjacent) music. It’s organised by record shop and label Crypt of the Wizard, who over the years have become trustworthy and well-connected curators of note in the “____ metal” world. 

If you’re even slightly into this style of music, I’d recommend going next year. I was only vaguely familiar with a small portion of the lineup but enjoyed every act I saw. There was something for everyone (into this music) here. From serene dungeon synth to black metal, from pagan beats to industrial black metal, from “frog concert” to blackened death metal (not to mention harsh noise).

It’s a cliche that the scenes around brutal music are friendly and welcoming but Life After Death 2 didn’t disprove this! Walthamstow Trade Hall was also a fantastic setting for the proceedings (and has a very reasonably priced bar). I’m happy next year will be at the same venue. 

I’m highlighting Vacuous here as I was so impressed by their set that I had to immediately cop the vinyl. That’s unusual for me, especially a death metal record that I’ll be able to play on rare occasions!

### Coma - Eiko Ishibashi

I’ve written about Eiko Ishibashi before but it’s been about her instrumental albums or soundtracks. “Antigone” is the first album focused on conventional song structure for several years. 

Unlike some of her previous records, the division between her ouvres 

It blurs the line between her 

Listening to it, you can hear that the line between her more experimental


With his record, she brings the lush instrumental of her soundtracks to the songwriting and percussion of 

“Antigone” 

is her first record for several years that puts the focus on her singing. 

It’s another great work,  her soundtracking   

combining the lush soundscapes of her soundtrack work with the songwriting 

percussion, her work is really unique in that there’s large percussive elements to it (which I absolutely love as a drummer, as I’ve mentioned a few times on here also)

I’d love to her live with a drummer or a live percussionist of some sort, though I did see her play songs from Drive My Car (and it was excellent), I did really miss the live drum 

The first song I heard from Ishibashi was Resurrection, in 2015.

### Panda (Nananana) - YT

I assumed from the OI! album art that YT would be offering a British take on the snap revival that Tisakorean is a figurehead of. In fact, YT is offering a British take on the jerk subgenre that Xaviersobased is a figurehead of.

OI! is (even) less heady and more immediate than a lot of jerk rap. This is pop music (not a slight!) and sands down some of jerk’s edges (not a slight!). I don’t think my initial 

 also hear a snap influence despite YT’s delivery. The beats are clearly pulling from that era, they’d be at home in the CD player of a high mileage first car or being transferred between phones using Bluetooth on a bus.

OI! short enough that it makes a trip to the shops to get milk or bread more enjoyable (haven’t been to a “club” since 2019) and it’s songs are stuck in my head like “nananana” (Panda (Nananana)).

### Ester Wind - Cloakroom

In the (excellent) Indieheads Podcast, Ian (Kermode) and Steven (Mayo) have talked about historical scenes defined by their participants being redefined by new generations. The internet making information more available and the tendency for different people to come to similar conclusions separately, has resulted in ahistorical and/or a-geographical additions to once concretely defined subcultures. 

Shoegaze is an excellent example of this, the extended shoegaze canon is now a much broader (stylistically and geographically) church than the big three. I (albeit as someone not born when Loveless was released) don’t inherently object to this, “Coldplay is shoegaze” aside (but uhh listen to this) it does result in the originators of a sound getting their due (I don’t recall the great AR Kane being talked about when I got into shoegaze). 


Of those new additions, Hum loom very large. 

Cloakroom pick up the baton from Hum (RIP the goat ) and run with it. You could probably apply this to a lot of band 

There’s always a dilemma when a record is just a great execution of a sound and so there’s not really much else to write about. This track is definitely a more nimble number than a typical Hum track though

Sure, it’s fits in very neatly 

Sure, it’s very similar to Hum. What’s the problem with that though? Hum rule! Cloakroom rule too!

### Total Euphoria - caroline

caroline’s S/T was a refreshing take on post-rock, reviving a well trodden path with aspects of emo and slowcore. Whereas the last album had a live-in-the-room feel, “Total Euphoria” uses the studio as additional instrument to 


 drained well with emo and slowcore. 


Can’t wait for the new record, caroline’s S/T was superb. 


While the previous record had a live and unprocessed feel, this track introduces some BJ Burton esque studio manipulation.
